    <p>
      Dear Siu Family,<br><br>
Sustainability has ability to forecast the prioritized long-tenured consequences by means of usage methods where
turning scarce resources into smart decisions with a conservative approach.<br>
Long words short, it is all abouth the World we are leaving inheritance to our children and grandchildren<br><br>
We, as Siu are constantly on a grind towards improving our business, starting from the product lifecycle design,
raw material, production, storage, marketing and sale, to components implementetion, recovery, repair and recycle.<br><br>
The purpose of our foundation is to efficiently use the natural resources (water, energy,soil,animals,plants,biodiversity,
ecosystems) with the inspiration we have from the mother earth and embracing an environmentalist vision.<br><br>
Our socio-economic actions involve the fields of our stakeholders such as factories, transportation chains and store
emplpyees whom are striving for.<br><br>
This is a rebellion, for a better World and clean resources to our next generations.Collaboration with the mother earth
is an essential factor for us to be transparent and a human rights activist brand.<br><br>
Under the lights os these mantra, we are always here to help you go greener on your wardrobe.

        <p>
          Fast fashion items often undergo a long and intense chemical
          process before ending up on our hangers. Around <span>8,000
          different synthetic</span> chemicals are used to dye, bleach and wet

      LESS WATER
        </h1>
        <p>
          Water is major resource for the fashion industry. It is
          used in the dyeing and finishing process for nearly all
          of our clothes. It takes an incredible amount of <span>2,700
          litres of water</span> to produces a single T-shirt. Cotton
          in particular is highly dependent on water, but usually
          grown in hot and dry areas where water is a scarce
          resource already. By contrast, <span>Organic Cotton reduces
          water consumption by 91%</span> as opposed to conventional
          cotton.
